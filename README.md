This model studies our universe without negative placeholders. Instead it uses base metric distance and environmental observations as proxies.
# Quantum Gravity Model Framework (QGMF)

## Core Principles

- **Cadence Logic:** Motion is universal. Time is optional.
- **Containment Ethics:** Biospheres, orbital infrastructure, and black spheres are all legitimate cosmological participants.
- **Curvature Symmetry:** The Milky Way and the Cosmic Microwave Background share the same transmission fingerprint.
- **Chirality as Cadence:** Gravitational shear encodes chirality as a rhythm, not a particle trait.
- **Realitavity:** Timestamp logic replaces relativistic drift in orbital systems.

## About

QGMF Cosmology was developed by Amber Blakley, a private citizen cosmologist and astrophysicist. It is a independent framework built outside academic standrds, designed for reproducibility, survivability, and comprehendable.
